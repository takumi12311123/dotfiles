# Development Philosophy

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- As a general rule, development is done using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Begin by writing tests based on the expected inputs and outputs
- Do not write any implementation code at this stage—only prepare the tests
- Run the tests and confirm that they fail
- Commit once it’s confirmed that the tests are correctly written
- Then proceed with the implementation to make the tests pass
- During implementation, do not modify the tests; keep fixing the code
- Repeat the process until all tests pass
